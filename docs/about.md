1 about the reference framework
==================
This is the development version for the reference framework for first mile farm data. This resource aims to evolve into a set of shared principles on how to  collect, store and exchange data about farmers, farmer organisations, farms, plots and other data related to agricultural practice.   

The term ‘the first mile’ refers to the position of farmers at the start of the agricultural value chain. When moving up the chain, following all steps towards consumption the distance to these food production area’s literally increases. While transparency and traceability in the value chain is of growing importance, data collection about ‘the first mile’ is generally difficult due to logistical reasons. There are many food producers and they are generally located in more remote areas making data collection labour intensive and expensive, especially in the case of small holder farming.

The purpose of the reference framework for first mile farm data is to align the way in which data about farmers, farms and farm practices are collected and stored by different organisations to facilitate the data exchange and interoperability of first mile farm data sets. 

The current version provides elements:
1. **A generic data model for first mile farm data.** by conceptually modelling the relations between the core data entities such as fields, farms, farmers and farmer organisations for first mile farm data collecion. This generic data model can be used as a template for organisations to structure first-mile farm data collected in the field. The model can also function as a neutral data model for data exchange between organisations. The generic data model is designed in such away that it should be relatively straight forward for other organisations to make a mapping from their own internal data structures to generic first mile data model. The data model is available in JSON format and in xls format in GitHub.

2. **Extensions.** The first mile farm data model can be easily be expanded with new data attributes or even new data entities for different purposes. This is demonstrated in the section with the extensions where examples are added for Cocoa action program and MARS Adoption Observations. For the 2 programs the data formats are available as together with  protocols on how to collect the data in the field. By adding more and more extensions to the framework, a central repositry emerges of proven data formats and their data collection protocols. Organsations can benefit from this repositry harvesting the data formats and data collection protocols they need, contributing the standardization and interoperability of first-mile farm data collection in the field. 

3. In addition a approach **to uniquely identify first mile farm data globally** using a system of 3 identifiers is presented and best practice recommendations are given for **spatial data collection** in the field.

These three elements provide the basis for the reference framework. Other organisations are invited to help extending the framework by adding the data standards and data collection protocols.

The development of this framework has been developed by [UTZ](https://utz.org/) supported by [Data-Impact.com](http://www.Data-Impact.com) and [Open Data Services](http://www.opendataservices.coop/) and is funded by [ISEAL](https://www.isealalliance.org/)

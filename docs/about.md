About the reference frame
==================

This is verion 1.0 for the reference framework for first mile farm data. This resource aims to evolve into a set of shared guidelines on how to  collect, store and exchange data about farmers, farmer organisations, farms, plots and other data related to agricultural practice.   

The reference framework is posted on github and intended as a building block for other organisations to collectively work on a shared repositry of data standards and data collection methodologies for data elements generally collected in the field for M&E, research,  certification and other purposes. 

The term ‘the first mile’ refers to the position of farmers at the start of the agricultural value chain. When moving up the chain, following all steps towards consumption, the distance to these food production area’s literally increases. While transparency and traceability in the value chain is of growing importance, data collection about ‘the first mile’ is generally difficult due to logistical reasons. There are many food producers and they are generally located in more remote areas making data collection labour intensive and expensive, especially in the case of small holder farming.
